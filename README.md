        <p>Well I've never been much of a blogger but here we are. I think I've always been more into the design part of blogs rather than the actual writing part. At least I get to code it to look however I want! I like the simplistic look it currently has, but maybe I should spice it up with a picture (I wish we weren't forced to use what they have).</p>

        <p>At least this ice cream looks tasty, right? Personally, I'd be trying the pink one witht eh blueberries. At least I think those are blueberries. Well I'm sure they're all good. Except maybe the pistachio on the bottom. I like pistachios, but as ice cream? Maybe not for me... I guess I'll have to try it someday. </p>

        <p>Hi again. Not much has happened since the last post since I've been forced to write them at the same time. No offense Khan Academy. I mean this is turning out to be more humorous than about coding. How is one supposed to document their progress, anyways? I mean you're looking at it right now. So I'm just filling space so my href links will actually take you somewhere. That's right, I said it. I hope you like knowing all my secrets. Good day.</p>
